## Embedded Software Engineer

I'm passionate about embedded systems and love learning through hands-on experience.

### Current Focus
- **Learning:** Advanced power optimization for solar-powered IoT gateways
- **Looking to collaborate on:** Open-source embedded projects using Nordic platforms
- **Ask me about:** Nordic SDK, Zephyr RTOS, cellular IoT, or embedded C programming
- **Reach me at:** mattb@hoptech.co.nz

### Featured Projects

#### [Fine-Grained Positioning System]
Trilateration-based asset tracking using Multi-carrier Phase Difference
- **Tech Stack:** Nordic Semiconductor, Zephyr RTOS

#### [Solar-Powered IoT Gateway]
Power-efficient dual-SoC gateway for remote monitoring
- **Tech Stack:** Nordic Thingy91 (nRF9160 + nRF52840), Zephyr RTOS, Cellular IoT
- **Key Features:** BLE scanning, cellular data transmission, intelligent power throttling
- **Challenges Overcome:** Flash management, stack overflows, RAM optimization

#### [Legacy Network Modernization]
Tools and documentation for maintaining large-scale embedded Linux deployments

- **Purpose:** Improve reliability of 1000+ devices in challenging RF environments
- **Impact:** Created comprehensive troubleshooting documentation, reduced downtime

### Professional Experience

**Embedded Software Engineer** @ Descartes Systems Group *(July 2023 - September 2025)*
- Maintain 1000+ embedded Linux devices in airport cargo environments
- Develop IoT solutions using Nordic nRF9160/nRF52840 with Zephyr RTOS
- Implement MQTT-based communication over cellular networks
- Resolve complex embedded challenges: memory management, power optimization, remote debugging

**Software Engineer / Junior CAD Engineer** @ F&C Technologies *(July 2020 - July 2023)*
- Designed embedded software solutions for Arduino platforms
- Created debugging applications for multi-FPGA systems
- Designed and manufactured PCBs using CAD software and automated assembly tools

### Learning Philosophy

- I learn by doing and making mistakes

- I believe the best way to understand embedded systems is through practical experience. I also have the firm belief that there is no use in dealing with half finished code bases that have been bloated and broken by improper AI usage; I prefer to start   fresh and make something do what it is intended to do rather than jump through the hoops that have been created by over engineering.  

### Notable Achievements

- Successfully created positioning system for an academic project
- Optimized solar-powered gateway achieving weeks of autonomous operation
- Maintained 99%+ uptime across 1000+ devices in challenging RF environments

### Based in New Zealand
- Richmond, Nelson Region
- Bachelor of IT (Software Major) - NMIT 2024
- Former chef turned engineer - bringing precision and problem-solving skills to embedded systems
